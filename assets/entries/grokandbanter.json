        "At Grok + Banter we were building an end-to-end platform to support our own computer-vision powered, marketing analytics IoT device. By tracking reactions to out-of-home advertisements we hoped to provide actionable insights strong enough to bring out-of-home marketing back into the limelight.",
        "I took ownership of our IoT device with embedded computer vision software. As a fresh college graduate have so much responsibility and expectation was difficult but very beneficial to my development as an engineer. I went from zero knowledge of computer vision, embedded systems, and data streams to working very closely with those and more every day.",
        "My interest in embedded systems has remained with me although the company was not able to continue to support a staff. I plan to explore IoT and “screenless” computers in the future."
