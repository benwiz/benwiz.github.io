# TO DO

- in getEntries(), preprocess all the json files into objects
- then iterate through all entry objects and collect all bubbles. Overlapping bubbles by coordinate & bubble size OR by city/country/region should only have one bubble on the map. Each bubble on the map will be associated with a list of all entries relating to that bubble.
