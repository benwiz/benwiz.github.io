## Notes

## To Do

- Buttons are not perfectly centered on mobile
- After adding something to balance out Burn, rethink the order of all my project buttons 
- Build UI components for boba.js configs
  - Color slider, maybe have separate hue, saturation, value sliders
  - Do I want labels on the toggles?
  - Speed? Size? There was some reason I initially didn't want to include these.
- Upgrade to webpack 4
