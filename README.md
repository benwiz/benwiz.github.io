## What

My personal website.

## How

Unnecessary use of Webpack to build ES6 JavaScript and Scss with Material Design Components.

## Development

Use in two shells:

```sh
npm run webpack
npm start
```

Push to master to publish.

## Note

Do not migrate to ClojureScript. Do not migrate to vanilla js and css. The only reason to migrate away from the current setup is if I do a complete redesign.

## To Do

- Buttons are not perfectly centered on mobile
- Redesign website
