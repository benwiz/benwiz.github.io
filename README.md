## Notes

## To Do

- Build UI components for boba.js configs
  - Color configs will either need to be non-configurable or will need to change material design colors

- Upgrade to webpack 4
- Consider if `target="_blank"` for external links (plus files) and `target=""` for internal links is the right choice
