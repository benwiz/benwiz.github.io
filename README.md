# benwiz.github.io

My personal website

## Notes

Use in two shells:

```sh
npm run webpack
npm start
```

Don't use:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Push to master to publish.

## To Do

- Resume and website should use same font. Consider switching to Raleway + Lato. I really like Lato. Website currently uses Merriweather
- Buttons are not perfectly centered on mobile
