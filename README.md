## Ideas

- Size of bubble corresponds to amount of time spent

## To Do

- Can I use markdown for desining the actual content of the entry? Keep it inside the same json strcuture that contains the metadata.
- Design modal content
- Detect if user is on mobile and redirect to a different page or throw a modal (probably redirect cuz modal may not work well on some devices).

- Later
  - Figure out a better html templating system than javascript with ES6 string templating
  - Script that generates an entry json template. Or maybe the json could be scratched in favor of markdown?
  - Make bubbles prettier
  - Make map prettier
  - Make background prettier
  - Add a title
  - Maybe get rid of Antarctica
  - Make mobile disclaimer pretty. Then make it useful.
