My personal website

## Notes

Use in two shells:

```sh
npm run webpack
npm start
```

Don't use:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Push to master to publish.

Do not try to move to ClojureScript or something without webpack. It works and is fairly simple as is. Only do a rewrite if I have a really good design.
... Actually, ClojureScript with Crinkle and Material-UI plus a new background using Quil could be even simpler to maintain. But I still need a good new design.

Or what could be better is using tailwind css and a pure html static webpage. Single html file, that's it.

## To Do
