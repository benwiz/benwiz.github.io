# benwiz.github.io

My personal website

## Notes

Use in two shells:

```sh
npm run webpack
npm start
```

Don't use:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Push to master to publish.

Do not try to move to ClojureScript or something without webpack. It works and is fairly simple as is. Only do a rewrite if I have a really good design.

## To Do

- Buttons are not perfectly centered on mobile
- Add links to
  - Spyfall
  - Codenames Trio
  - WWOZ playlist
