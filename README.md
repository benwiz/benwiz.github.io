My personal website

## Notes

Use in two shells:

```sh
npm run webpack
npm start
```

Don't use:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Push to master to publish.

## To Do

- Resume and website should use same font. Consider switching to Raleway + Lato. I really like Lato. Website currently uses Merriweather
- Buttons are not perfectly centered on mobile
- After adding something to balance out Burn, rethink the order of all my project buttons 
- Build UI components for boba.js configs
  - Color slider, maybe have separate hue, saturation, value sliders
  - Do I want labels on the toggles?
  - Speed? Size? There was some reason I initially didn't want to include these.
- Upgrade to webpack 4
