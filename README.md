## Notes

Got set up using [getting started with material design](https://material.io/components/web/docs/getting-started/). Needed to specify `extract-loader@1`.

## Useful commands

Start local server.

```bash
npm start
```

Start local server that better simulates what GitHub Pages does.

```bash
http-server
```

To build updates while making changes

```bash
npx webpack --watch
```

## To Do

- Background: p5.js delaunay nets or one giant one as a wall... thinking flitting small ones is better
  - probably will go back to floating secondary card
- Custom pictures for each content-set
  - Squiggle: a slow moving dashed spiral or something simple and good for background, use p5.js or processing.js. Or, better yet, create it in Squiggle then create a gif of it.
  - Lowpoly: a really good looking picture, maybe kaminsky's
  - WWOZ: embedded spotify play button
  - Lucid: a picture of me at Lucid
  - G+B: logo? a picture of a person with a yellow box?
  - BragOn: dragon
  - Tulane: picture from Tulane years or of Tulane
  - Profile: a digital sketch or characature
- Fix G+B logo
- Fix WWOZ-to-Spotify logo
- Height of card should not change between content switches
- Do I want to chop corners off the cards?
