## Notes

Got set up using [getting started with material design](https://material.io/components/web/docs/getting-started/). Needed to specify `extract-loader@1`.

## Useful commands

Start local server.

```bash
npm start
```

Start local server that better simulates what GitHub Pages does.

```bash
http-server
```

To build updates while making changes

```bash
npx webpack --watch
```

## To Do

- Better content description for each card. This is the last step before merging into master to deploy.
- Custom pictures for each card
- Use a better background. Probably make it using p5.js.
