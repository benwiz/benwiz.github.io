## Notes

Got set up using [getting started with material design](https://material.io/components/web/docs/getting-started/). Needed to specify `extract-loader@1`.

## Useful commands

Start local server.

```bash
npm start
```

Start local server that better simulates what GitHub Pages does.

```bash
http-server
```

To build updates while making changes

```bash
npx webpack --watch
```

## To Do

- Better content description for each career card
- Height of card should not change between content switches
- Custom pictures for each content-set
    - Squiggle: a slow moving dashed spiral or something simply and good for background
    - Lowpoly: a really good looking picture, maybe kaminsky's
    - WWOZ: embedded spotify play button
    - Lucid: a picture of me at Lucid
    - G+B: logo? a picture of a person with a yellow box?
    - BragOn: dragon
    - Tulane: Picture from Tulane years or of Tulane
- Use a better background. Probably make it using p5.js
- Fix G+B logo
