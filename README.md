## Ideas

- Size of bubble corresponds to amount of time spent

## To Do

- Figure out entry data format
- Function that generates "place" data from "entries"
- Script that generates an entry template
- Figure out what info to display in tooltip and what should be displayed after click (probably in a modal but maybe elsewhere)
